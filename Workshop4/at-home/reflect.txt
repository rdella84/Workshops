1. A safe empty state means that object's instance is initialized to a default value using a constructor. This makes sure that there is no junk within object's instance. I would also add Passenger objects such as travelers, David and the array members of friends to be put into a safe empty state. This is done so to avoid junk within the files and just use a function for example set(); to set values for this objects.

2. Having multiple constructors simplify the code because each overloaded constructor can do its own function different from the rest and it can have different validation for a value to be set.

3. I learned to work with overloading functions and I also learned that creating a function to set values to a safe empty safe is more organized and easier rather than retyping every value again. I also learned how *this work by observing the display function as it displays the current object pointed by the *this. I also learned that you could set empty chars without using strcpy.
